WARNING: As announced in https://spring.io/blog/2022/12/16/spring-cloud-2022-0-0-codename-kilburn-has-been-released#spring-cloud-openfeign-feature-complete-announcement[Spring Cloud 2022.0.0 release blog entry], we're now treating the Spring Cloud OpenFeign project as feature-complete. We are only going to be adding bugfixes and possibly merging some small community feature PRs. We suggest migrating over to https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-interface[Spring Interface Clients] instead.
