== Declarative REST Client: Feign

https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign[Feign] is a declarative web service client.
It makes writing web service clients easier.
To use Feign create an interface and annotate it.
It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations and JAX-RS annotations.
Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders.
Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same `HttpMessageConverters` used by default in Spring Web.
Spring Cloud integrates Eureka, as well as Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to provide a load-balanced http client when using Feign.

[[netflix-feign-starter]]
=== How to Include Feign

To include Feign in your project use the starter with group `org.springframework.cloud`
and artifact id `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign`. See the https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page]
for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

Example spring boot app

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
----

.StoreClient.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient("stores")
public interface StoreClient {
    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/stores")
    List<Store> getStores();

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/stores")
    Page<Store> getStores(Pageable pageable);

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, value = "/stores/{storeId}", consumes = "application/json")
    Store update(@PathVariable("storeId") Long storeId, Store store);
}
----

In the `@FeignClient` annotation the String value ("stores" above) is an arbitrary client name, which is used to create a https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/spring-cloud-loadbalancer/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/loadbalancer/blocking/client/BlockingLoadBalancerClient.java[Spring Cloud LoadBalancer client].
You can also specify a URL using the `url` attribute
(absolute value or just a hostname). The name of the bean in the
application context is the fully qualified name of the interface.
To specify your own alias value you can use the `qualifier` value
of the `@FeignClient` annotation.

The load-balancer client above will want to discover the physical addresses
for the "stores" service. If your application is a Eureka client then
it will resolve the service in the Eureka service registry. If you
don't want to use Eureka, you can simply configure a list of servers
in your external configuration using https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-commons/current/reference/html/#simplediscoveryclient[`SimpleDiscoveryClient`].

[[spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults]]
=== Overriding Feign Defaults

A central concept in Spring Cloud's Feign support is that of the named client. Each feign client is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer using the `@FeignClient` annotation. Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an
`ApplicationContext` on demand for each named client using `FeignClientsConfiguration`. This contains (amongst other things) an `feign.Decoder`, a `feign.Encoder`, and a `feign.Contract`.
It is possible to override the name of that ensemble by using the `contextId`
attribute of the `@FeignClient` annotation.

Spring Cloud lets you take full control of the feign client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the `FeignClientsConfiguration`) using `@FeignClient`. Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(name = "stores", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public interface StoreClient {
    //..
}
----

In this case the client is composed from the components already in `FeignClientsConfiguration` together with any in `FooConfiguration` (where the latter will override the former).

NOTE: `FooConfiguration` does not need to be annotated with `@Configuration`. However, if it is, then take care to exclude it from any `@ComponentScan` that would otherwise include this configuration as it will become the default source for `feign.Decoder`, `feign.Encoder`, `feign.Contract`, etc., when specified. This can be avoided by putting it in a separate, non-overlapping package from any `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`, or it can be explicitly excluded in `@ComponentScan`.

NOTE: The `serviceId` attribute is now deprecated in favor of the `name` attribute.

NOTE: Using `contextId` attribute of the `@FeignClient` annotation in addition to changing the name of
the `ApplicationContext` ensemble, it will override the alias of the client name
and it will be used as part of the name of the configuration bean created for that client.

WARNING: Previously, using the `url` attribute, did not require the `name` attribute. Using `name` is now required.

Placeholders are supported in the `name` and `url` attributes.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(name = "${feign.name}", url = "${feign.url}")
public interface StoreClient {
    //..
}
----

Spring Cloud OpenFeign provides the following beans by default for feign (`BeanType` beanName: `ClassName`):

* `Decoder` feignDecoder: `ResponseEntityDecoder` (which wraps a `SpringDecoder`)
* `Encoder` feignEncoder: `SpringEncoder`
* `Logger` feignLogger: `Slf4jLogger`
* `Contract` feignContract: `SpringMvcContract`
* `Feign.Builder` feignBuilder: `HystrixFeign.Builder`
* `Client` feignClient: if Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is in the classpath, `FeignBlockingLoadBalancerClient` is used.
If none of them is in the classpath, the default feign client is used.

The OkHttpClient and ApacheHttpClient feign clients can be used by setting `feign.okhttp.enabled` or `feign.httpclient.enabled` to `true`, respectively, and having them on the classpath.
You can customize the HTTP client used by providing a bean of either `org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient` when using Apache or `okhttp3.OkHttpClient` when using OK HTTP.

Spring Cloud OpenFeign _does not_ provide the following beans by default for feign, but still looks up beans of these types from the application context to create the feign client:

* `Logger.Level`
* `ErrorDecoder`
* `Request.Options`
* `Collection<RequestInterceptor>`
* `SetterFactory`
* `QueryMapEncoder`

A bean of `Retryer.NEVER_RETRY` with the type `Retryer` is created by default, which will disable retrying.
Notice this retrying behavior is different from the Feign default one, where it will automatically retry IOExceptions,
treating them as transient network related exceptions, and any RetryableException thrown from an ErrorDecoder.

Creating a bean of one of those type and placing it in a `@FeignClient` configuration (such as `FooConfiguration` above) allows you to override each one of the beans described.  Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public Contract feignContract() {
        return new feign.Contract.Default();
    }

    @Bean
    public BasicAuthRequestInterceptor basicAuthRequestInterceptor() {
        return new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("user", "password");
    }
}
----

This replaces the `SpringMvcContract` with `feign.Contract.Default` and adds a `RequestInterceptor` to the collection of `RequestInterceptor`.

`@FeignClient` also can be configured using configuration properties.

application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
feign:
  client:
    config:
      feignName:
        connectTimeout: 5000
        readTimeout: 5000
        loggerLevel: full
        errorDecoder: com.example.SimpleErrorDecoder
        retryer: com.example.SimpleRetryer
        requestInterceptors:
          - com.example.FooRequestInterceptor
          - com.example.BarRequestInterceptor
        decode404: false
        encoder: com.example.SimpleEncoder
        decoder: com.example.SimpleDecoder
        contract: com.example.SimpleContract
----

Default configurations can be specified in the `@EnableFeignClients` attribute `defaultConfiguration` in a similar manner as described above. The difference is that this configuration will apply to _all_ feign clients.

If you prefer using configuration properties to configured all `@FeignClient`, you can create configuration properties with `default` feign name.

application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
feign:
  client:
    config:
      default:
        connectTimeout: 5000
        readTimeout: 5000
        loggerLevel: basic
----

If we create both `@Configuration` bean and configuration properties, configuration properties will win.
It will override `@Configuration` values. But if you want to change the priority to `@Configuration`,
you can change `feign.client.default-to-properties` to `false`.

NOTE: If you need to use `ThreadLocal` bound variables in your `RequestInterceptor`s you will need to either set the
thread isolation strategy for Hystrix to `SEMAPHORE` or disable Hystrix in Feign.

application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# To disable Hystrix in Feign
feign:
  hystrix:
    enabled: false

# To set thread isolation to SEMAPHORE
hystrix:
  command:
    default:
      execution:
        isolation:
          strategy: SEMAPHORE
----

If we want to create multiple feign clients with the same name or url
so that they would point to the same server but each with a different custom configuration then
we have to use `contextId` attribute of the `@FeignClient` in order to avoid name
collision of these configuration beans.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(contextId = "fooClient", name = "stores", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public interface FooClient {
    //..
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(contextId = "barClient", name = "stores", configuration = BarConfiguration.class)
public interface BarClient {
    //..
}
----

It is also possible to configure FeignClient not to inherit beans from the parent context.
You can do this by overriding the `inheritParentConfiguration()` in a  `FeignClientConfigurer`
bean to return `false`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class CustomConfiguration{

@Bean
public FeignClientConfigurer feignClientConfigurer() {
			return new FeignClientConfigurer() {

				@Override
				public boolean inheritParentConfiguration() {
					return false;
				}
			};

		}
}
----

=== Creating Feign Clients Manually

In some cases it might be necessary to customize your Feign Clients in a way that is not
possible using the methods above.  In this case you can create Clients using the
https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign/#basics[Feign Builder API]. Below is an example
which creates two Feign Clients with the same interface but configures each one with
a separate request interceptor.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Import(FeignClientsConfiguration.class)
class FooController {

	private FooClient fooClient;

	private FooClient adminClient;

    	@Autowired
	public FooController(Decoder decoder, Encoder encoder, Client client, Contract contract) {
		this.fooClient = Feign.builder().client(client)
				.encoder(encoder)
				.decoder(decoder)
				.contract(contract)
				.requestInterceptor(new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("user", "user"))
				.target(FooClient.class, "https://PROD-SVC");

		this.adminClient = Feign.builder().client(client)
				.encoder(encoder)
				.decoder(decoder)
				.contract(contract)
				.requestInterceptor(new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("admin", "admin"))
				.target(FooClient.class, "https://PROD-SVC");
    }
}
----

NOTE: In the above example `FeignClientsConfiguration.class` is the default configuration
provided by Spring Cloud Netflix.

NOTE: `PROD-SVC` is the name of the service the Clients will be making requests to.

NOTE: The Feign `Contract` object defines what annotations and values are valid on interfaces. The
autowired `Contract` bean provides supports for SpringMVC annotations, instead of
the default Feign native annotations.

You can also use the `Builder`to configure FeignClient not to inherit beans from the parent context.
You can do this by overriding calling `inheritParentContext(false)` on the `Builder`.

[[spring-cloud-feign-hystrix]]
=== Feign Hystrix Support

If Hystrix is on the classpath and `feign.hystrix.enabled=true`, Feign will wrap all methods with a circuit breaker. Returning a `com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand` is also available. This lets you use reactive patterns (with a call to `.toObservable()` or `.observe()` or asynchronous use (with a call to `.queue()`).

To disable Hystrix support on a per-client basis create a vanilla `Feign.Builder` with the "prototype" scope, e.g.:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    	@Bean
	@Scope("prototype")
	public Feign.Builder feignBuilder() {
		return Feign.builder();
	}
}
----

WARNING:  Prior to the Spring Cloud Dalston release, if Hystrix was on the classpath Feign would have wrapped
all methods in a circuit breaker by default.  This default behavior was changed in Spring Cloud Dalston in
favor for an opt-in approach.

[[spring-cloud-feign-hystrix-fallback]]
=== Feign Hystrix Fallbacks

Hystrix supports the notion of a fallback: a default code path that is executed when they circuit is open or there is an error. To enable fallbacks for a given `@FeignClient` set the `fallback` attribute to the class name that implements the fallback. You also need to declare your implementation as a Spring bean.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(name = "hello", fallback = HystrixClientFallback.class)
protected interface HystrixClient {
    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/hello")
    Hello iFailSometimes();
}

static class HystrixClientFallback implements HystrixClient {
    @Override
    public Hello iFailSometimes() {
        return new Hello("fallback");
    }
}
----

If one needs access to the cause that made the fallback trigger, one can use the `fallbackFactory` attribute inside `@FeignClient`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(name = "hello", fallbackFactory = HystrixClientFallbackFactory.class)
protected interface HystrixClient {
	@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/hello")
	Hello iFailSometimes();
}

@Component
static class HystrixClientFallbackFactory implements FallbackFactory<HystrixClient> {
	@Override
	public HystrixClient create(Throwable cause) {
		return new HystrixClient() {
			@Override
			public Hello iFailSometimes() {
				return new Hello("fallback; reason was: " + cause.getMessage());
			}
		};
	}
}
----

WARNING: There is a limitation with the implementation of fallbacks in Feign and how Hystrix fallbacks work. Fallbacks are currently not supported for methods that return `com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand` and `rx.Observable`.

=== Feign and `@Primary`

When using Feign with Hystrix fallbacks, there are multiple beans in the `ApplicationContext` of the same type. This will cause `@Autowired` to not work because there isn't exactly one bean, or one marked as primary. To work around this, Spring Cloud Netflix marks all Feign instances as `@Primary`, so Spring Framework will know which bean to inject. In some cases, this may not be desirable. To turn off this behavior set the `primary` attribute of `@FeignClient` to false.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient(name = "hello", primary = false)
public interface HelloClient {
	// methods here
}
----

[[spring-cloud-feign-inheritance]]
=== Feign Inheritance Support

Feign supports boilerplate apis via single-inheritance interfaces.
This allows grouping common operations into convenient base interfaces.

.UserService.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public interface UserService {

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value ="/users/{id}")
    User getUser(@PathVariable("id") long id);
}
----

.UserResource.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RestController
public class UserResource implements UserService {

}
----

.UserClient.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
package project.user;

@FeignClient("users")
public interface UserClient extends UserService {

}
----

NOTE: It is generally not advisable to share an interface between a
server and a client. It introduces tight coupling, and also actually
doesn't work with Spring MVC in its current form (method parameter
mapping is not inherited).

=== Feign request/response compression

You may consider enabling the request or response GZIP compression for your
Feign requests. You can do this by enabling one of the properties:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.response.enabled=true
----

Feign request compression gives you settings similar to what you may set for your web server:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.request.mime-types=text/xml,application/xml,application/json
feign.compression.request.min-request-size=2048
----

These properties allow you to be selective about the compressed media types and minimum request threshold length.

For http clients except OkHttpClient, default gzip decoder can be enabled to decode gzip response in UTF-8 encoding:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.response.enabled=true
feign.compression.response.useGzipDecoder=true
----

=== Feign logging

A logger is created for each Feign client created. By default the name of the logger is the full class name of the interface used to create the Feign client. Feign logging only responds to the `DEBUG` level.

.application.yml

[source,yaml]
----
logging.level.project.user.UserClient: DEBUG
----

The `Logger.Level` object that you may configure per client, tells Feign how much to log. Choices are:

* `NONE`, No logging (*DEFAULT*).
* `BASIC`, Log only the request method and URL and the response status code and execution time.
* `HEADERS`, Log the basic information along with request and response headers.
* `FULL`, Log the headers, body, and metadata for both requests and responses.

For example, the following would set the `Logger.Level` to `FULL`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    @Bean
    Logger.Level feignLoggerLevel() {
        return Logger.Level.FULL;
    }
}
----

=== Feign @QueryMap support

The OpenFeign `@QueryMap` annotation provides support for POJOs to be used as
GET parameter maps. Unfortunately, the default OpenFeign QueryMap annotation is
incompatible with Spring because it lacks a `value` property.

Spring Cloud OpenFeign provides an equivalent `@SpringQueryMap` annotation, which
is used to annotate a POJO or Map parameter as a query parameter map.

For example, the `Params` class defines parameters `param1` and `param2`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// Params.java
public class Params {
    private String param1;
    private String param2;

    // [Getters and setters omitted for brevity]
}
----

The following feign client uses the `Params` class by using the `@SpringQueryMap` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient("demo")
public interface DemoTemplate {

    @GetMapping(path = "/demo")
    String demoEndpoint(@SpringQueryMap Params params);
}
----

If you need more control over the generated query parameter map, you can implement a custom `QueryMapEncoder` bean.

=== HATEOAS support

Spring provides some APIs to create REST representations that follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[HATEOAS] principle, https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas[Spring Hateoas] and https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-rest[Spring Data REST].

If your project use the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-hateoas` starter
or the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-rest` starter, Feign HATEOAS support is enabled by default.

When HATEOAS support is enabled, Feign clients are allowed to serialize
and deserialize HATEOAS representation models: https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.0.0.M1/apidocs/org/springframework/hateoas/EntityModel.html[EntityModel], https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.0.0.M1/apidocs/org/springframework/hateoas/CollectionModel.html[CollectionModel] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.0.0.M1/apidocs/org/springframework/hateoas/PagedModel.html[PagedModel].

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient("demo")
public interface DemoTemplate {

    @GetMapping(path = "/stores")
    CollectionModel<Store> getStores();
}
----

=== Spring @MatrixVariable Support

Spring Cloud OpenFeign provides support for the Spring `@MatrixVariable` annotation.

If a map is passed as the method argument, the `@MatrixVariable` path segment is created by joining key-value pairs from the map with a `=`.

If a different object is passed, either the `name` provided in the `@MatrixVariable` annotation (if defined) or the annotated variable name is
joined with the provided method argument using `=`.

IMPORTANT:: Even though, on the server side, Spring does not require the users to name the path segment placeholder same as the matrix variable name, since it would be too ambiguous on the client side, Sprig Cloud OpenFeign requires that you add a path segment placeholder with a name matching either the `name` provided in the `@MatrixVariable` annotation (if defined) or the annotated variable name.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@GetMapping("/objects/links/{matrixVars}")
Map<String, List<String>> getObjects(@MatrixVariable Map<String, List<String>> matrixVars);
----
Note that both variable name and the path segment placeholder are called `matrixVars`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@FeignClient("demo")
public interface DemoTemplate {

    @GetMapping(path = "/stores")
    CollectionModel<Store> getStores();
}
----


=== Troubleshooting

==== Early Initialization Errors

Depending on how you are using your Feign clients you may see initialization errors when starting your application.
To work around this problem you can use an `ObjectProvider` when autowiring your client.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
ObjectProvider<TestFeginClient> testFeginClient;
----
